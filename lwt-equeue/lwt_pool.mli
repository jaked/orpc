(** Creating pools (for example pools of connections to a database). *)

(** Instead of creating a new connection each time you need one,
    keep a pool of opened connections and reuse opened connections
    that are free.
 *)

(** Type of pools *)
type 'a t

(** [create n f] creates a new pool with at most [n] members.
    [f] is the function to use to create a new pool member. *)
val create :
  int -> ?check:('a -> (bool -> unit) -> unit) -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a t

(** [use p f] takes one free member of the pool [p] and gives it to the function
    [f].
 *)
val use : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b Lwt.t) -> 'b Lwt.t
